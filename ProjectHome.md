XMODEM is well known, a little bit old, but still working protocol for data transfer over serial connection.I started this project because I needed to transfer some binary files from a PC to Arduino compatible board. I could not manage to find any existing solution and decided to provide simple XMODEM implementation. This implementation is done from scratch and is coded in C++.
